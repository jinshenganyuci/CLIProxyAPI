# Bundled management UI

The image serves `static/management.html` at `/management.html`. It is built from:

- repository: `router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center`
- tag: `v1.25.0`
- commit: `b87b9487f63e08ad97b1fb4e7c17b4adb811b922`
- patch: `management-center-v1.25.0-credential-identity.patch`

The patch adds independent Codex, Devin, Meta, Kimi Code (kimi.com), and Kimi.ai
login proxy selectors. Proxy credentials are sent in the
POST body and held only in page memory; successful login and cancellation clear
the input. The selected egress is saved with the credential for later use. Native Devin OAuth
callback/cancellation, quota refresh, reset timelines, and cooldown views are
retained alongside the fork's Codex identity and reauthentication controls. Devin callback
guidance uses the v7.3.2 HTTP loopback `/callback` URL; validation remains compatible
with callbacks from earlier releases. The native Devin quota flow queries
GetUserStatus through the management API with the selected credential index and a
body token placeholder, retaining request deduplication and stale-session guards.
It no longer falls back to old auth-file quota observations.

Meta device login displays the authorization URL, optional device code, expiry guidance,
and cancellation controls without a callback form. Its selected proxy is sent through
`POST /oauth/auth-url?provider=meta` and stays locked until completion or cancellation. Browser
authorization uses the browser's own network settings. All four locales are included.
The native Meta API-key editor is included. It preserves unknown backend configuration fields and
per-credential concurrency settings when saving a current provider form. Stale or ambiguous
provider snapshots are rejected before a write. Meta quota
queries read the current DCA token from the selected auth file and use its auth index for
`POST /requests/api-call`; the selected credential proxy remains authoritative. Only projected quota
fields enter the cache or UI, and stale session/file responses are discarded. Missing usage
is displayed as unknown. Usage-window and weekly reset timelines are included.

Kimi Code retains its original kimi.com endpoint and registration link. Kimi.ai has a
separate device-login card and provider parameter; it does not replace existing Kimi Code accounts.
Both use POST JSON bodies for the selected proxy, distinguish inherited global settings
from explicit direct access, freeze proxy fields during the attempt, and clear secrets on
success or cancellation. Device codes and optional expiry are displayed without callback
forms. The native Kimi.ai backend has no dedicated quota adapter in this UI version, so
its accounts are not silently routed through the Kimi Code quota endpoint.

The native UI includes quota search by filename or email, Codex Business Premium entitlement
recognition and a live renewal-date lookup, Claude Team plan precedence, xAI billing-window
and unknown-usage corrections, plain credential-weight tooltips, and theme-aware plugin
resource backgrounds. Codex usage, renewal, and reset-credit requests all keep the selected
auth index through the management API. Renewal lookup is optional and falls back to the
credential date when unavailable. Search retains the shared concurrency polling context.

Native regional login cards separate Kimi China (kimi.com) and Kimi International (kimi.ai) into
separate featured cards, each with its own registration link. The fork retains one card
per region and its existing POST proxy, cancellation, device-code, and expiry behavior.
The quota search field and sorting now share a separate toolbar below provider navigation;
its clear action restores input focus. Provider tabs support vertical mouse-wheel scrolling
when horizontally overflowing, preserve horizontal gestures and zoom, and hide scrollbars.

Credential cards, compact rows, details, and quota cards share a small live concurrency badge
showing occupied requests and the effective limit. Each active page uses one lightweight
`GET /credentials/concurrency` poll every two seconds, pauses while hidden, and discards
cancelled or stale-session responses. Failed or missing observations show unknown occupancy
instead of zero. Home-managed credentials display `— / Home` and disable local editing.

The credential editor accepts integer limits from 1 through 1,000,000. An empty field sends
`concurrency_limit: null` to restore the default of 10. Configuration-backed API-key credentials
use a concurrency-only editor, selected by the server's `concurrency_config` capability; this
editor writes the limit through the stable `auth_index` without downloading an auth file or
changing unrelated credential fields. Plugin virtual credentials retain their native controls.
Provider forms also preserve per-key and OpenAI-compatible fallback limits through normalization,
editing, and serialization. An older provider snapshot is rejected if concurrent changes make
its persisted identity ambiguous or stale. Refreshing the form reads the current admission
limits; ordinary provider edits do not overwrite those limits.

Provider model rows preserve backend fields, including `use-max-completion-tokens`
and `support-configuration-update`, through the native persisted row identity. Reordering,
renaming, or deleting rows cannot move one row's settings to another. Invalid or repeated
row identities fail before a write. New rows retain their default capability settings.
These options remain available in the native YAML editor.

Model discovery for a selected OpenAI-compatible credential never retries without its auth
index after failure, preserving the configured credential proxy. Unbound public endpoints
retain their anonymous model-list fallback.

The v1.25.0 UI uses `/v8/management` and the native nested configuration editor.
It supersedes the fork's temporary v0 visual-layout adapter. A configuration GET renders
legacy files as a v8 view without migrating the file; the first successful v8 configuration
mutation migrates persisted settings. Client keys under `access.api-keys` remain separate
from upstream groups under top-level `api-keys`. Provider writes preserve group policies,
null inheritance, unknown fields and credential row identity, with connection-switch guards.
Visual edits use targeted PATCH/DELETE/PUT operations. Recovery after partial writes does
not replay stale list indexes; conflicting list or payload replacements require a refresh.
Source YAML mode still replaces the entire supplied document. This is not an atomic
compare-and-swap guarantee against writes occurring after the current snapshot.

Codex identity operations use `/credentials/codex-identity`, with initialization and rotation
subpaths. Login proxy passwords remain in POST JSON bodies; only the provider name is a
query parameter. Selected-credential model discovery never silently loses its auth index
on retry. Unbound discovery forwards its explicit proxy to the anonymous fallback.

The native cooldown-reset action, disabled credential styling, model-discovery merging,
and new logs workspace are included. Logs support wrapping, filters, scrolling buffers,
full-screen mode, and Escape events already handled by another component. The parser and
download request retain complete UUIDs as well as historical eight-hex-digit IDs. Local
filenames still use the final eight hex digits, and backend downloads select the latest
matching suffix: preserving a full ID in the UI does not make that lookup globally unique.

Rebuild the asset from a clean checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center.git management-center
git -C management-center checkout b87b9487f63e08ad97b1fb4e7c17b4adb811b922
git -C management-center apply --unidiff-zero ../webui/management-center-v1.25.0-credential-identity.patch
docker run --rm --cpus 2 --memory 2g -e VERSION=v1.25.0 \
  -v "$PWD/management-center:/app" -w /app oven/bun:1.3.14 \
  sh -c 'bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run verify'
install -m 0644 management-center/dist/index.html static/management.html
sha256sum static/management.html
```

Expected SHA-256 for this source snapshot:

```text
2053fecee8a72f9338e6ff125b73f855467deb907b8b9334eb16046baf82f238
```

The Docker image sets `MANAGEMENT_STATIC_IMMUTABLE=true` so the upstream panel
auto-updater cannot overwrite the matching bundled UI at runtime.
